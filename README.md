### 📚 An Open-Source Resource to Elevate Drone Education, AI Innovation, and Technical Literacy

Welcome to the **GEPRC.com Documentation Archive** — a public, open-source initiative to preserve and share the original documentation from [GEPRC.com](https://geprc.com). Whether you're a student, educator, drone builder, or AI researcher, this repo was made for you. 💡🌍

---

## 💡 What is This?

This project is a **community-powered archive** of the full documentation from GEPRC’s official website — including manuals, configuration guides, tuning instructions, and technical specifications for drones, parts, and systems.

These documents are being **open-sourced** for public use, study, education, and AI training. This initiative is not affiliated with GEPRC, but it exists to preserve knowledge and **expand access to high-quality drone documentation**.

---

## 🎯 Our Mission

We believe that access to technology should be **free, open, and empowering**.

By making this documentation openly available, we aim to:

- 📘 **Educate**: Give students, hobbyists, and engineers the tools to learn and build with drones
- 🤖 **Innovate**: Provide AI and ML developers with real-world technical content for model training
- 🧠 **Inspire**: Encourage self-learning and experimentation with high-quality reference material
- 📦 **Preserve**: Archive important documentation that could otherwise be lost over time

Together, we can help more people unlock the potential of drone technology. 🚁🌐
